CHESTER—Amscan, Party City’s wholesale division, will lay off 471 workers and shut down its Orange County distribution center as the company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

The site is scheduled to close on Friday, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filed last month with the state Department of Labor. Among the affected workers are material handlers, supervisors, and human resources staff, said Kristina Patsalos, a supervisor at the Orange County Employment and Training Administration. It was not immediately clear if the workers, who are not unionized, would receive severance.
